Writing issues(tickets, tasks)
    -User Stories
        -as a person i want to do something so that reason
        -software should be designed based on what the users of the software want
        -stories are not the same as implementation details

    -Implementation Details
        -how to fulfill a user story
        -should always serve a user story
        -typically you will write a ticket for each implementation detail (not for each user story)
